Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.

The creation of the Promise happens in the main thread, thus console.log('Sum called ...') is always called first.
Also observe that the "Rejection" case or thread ends earlier because the "Successful" case is an N^2 operation, so it's slower.
This actually shows that these two invocations are ran asynchronously.
